    <h1>Single Video</h1>

    <p>Note that if the video isn't loading, it's highly likely that the user has denied the web page from
        accessing the camera and/or mic.</p>

    <p>If you are using Chrome on a Mac, look out for an icon similar to <i class="fa fa-video-camera"></i> in
        the address bar. Click on the icon to allow your device to have access.</p>
