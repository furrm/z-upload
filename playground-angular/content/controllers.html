    <h1>Controllers</h1>
    <p>Controllers in AngularJS are responsible for coordinating the view and model.  Always keep controllers as simple
    as possible.  Don't try and make a controller do too many things.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Coordinate the view and model.</li>
        <li>Limit the number of collaborator objects.</li>
        <li>Controllers need to be testable.</li>
    </ul>
