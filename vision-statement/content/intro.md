#Vision Statement

The following ramblings are in response to a question put to me during an interview I had for the role of Solution Architect at a prestigious law firm in the city of 
london. The question was to around what my vision is for a technical roadmap and what would be the first things I would do in the during the first few months of my new
 role if I was the successful candidate.
   
##The Droids are Taking Over the World!!

##The Computer Revolution

Ok, droids maybe not quite taking over the world, but we are certainly entering a new era of the computer revolution...

Over the last few years we have seen tools demonstrate abilities that we have never seen before.  Such services are now taken for granted. Take for example the 
translation services that are available to us today.  Once upon a time, using translation services required human intervention who are subject matter experts in a 
particular language, but we are now seeing translations services being accessible for everyone to use via devices such as the desktop all the way down to smart phones.  
If we now take a look at what is available to us compare to what we had a few years ago, we have:
 
 - real-time translation via Skype,
 - just-in-time translation via ###,
 - augmented translation via apps that run on Google Glass, iPhone and Android such as World Lens,
 - and wearable technology that translate sign language into words.

Technologies such as Siri and Google Speak allow us to control our devices by voice to do execute specific tasks.  Technologies such as Microsoft Kinect are allowing 
humans to interact with computers, TV's and other devices by using gestures, either for recreational pleasure or to improve the life of people with disabilities. 
 

We are also now seeing computers moving away from being task driven to become generalists.  IBM's super computer, Watson, has appeared on general knowledge game shows in 
the US and it has beaten human competitors hands down.  Imagine a technology such as Siri being integrated with Watson.

We are also seeing algorithm's and artificial intelligence being used to automate the creation of reports and articles where it is hard to distinguish whether it has 
been produced by a human or machine.

Big data is helping institutions to predict human behaviour; from our shopping habits all the way to how we react to a natural disaster or predict industry trends.  Big 
data and artificial intelligence is also playing a big part of machine learning, allowing data to be used to assist common-sense reasoning and making machines smarter.

Advanced wearable technologies are becoming more and more accessible to consumers; wearable technology that will have the equivalent processing power of the personal 
computer 10 years ago. We are already seeing wrist bands that monitor your general health, and integrate with your smartphone you provide stats, and companies such as 
Samsung and Sony are providing the first generation of smart watches with Apple rumored to release their first smart watch. Wearable technologies will have a bigger 
impact in the way humans interact with tech than what the introduction of smart phones did.

iBeacon, or Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) technology built into smart phones and wearable technologies will transform the way in which humans interact with data, 
services and our day-to-day objects. BLE is a proximity technology, which introduces an accuracy that can't be achieved with GPRS alone.  Because BLE doesn't require 
much energy to transmit a signal, it can be powered by low energy sources such as batteries or solar energy.  We will start to see our devices and wearable tech 
unlocking cars and houses, allow us to pay for goods similar to credit cars touch payment terminals and pay car parking charges etc. And given BLE is so 
compact and versatile, you may see things that you use on a day-to-day basis being BLE enabled.  Take bags for example, you could have your device alert you should you 
leave your bag at the pub, or more importantly, alert you as soon as someone decides to steal it!
    
All of the above tech was unthinkable several years ago but we are using this tech more and more on a day-to-day basis.  Granted that while the above technologies are 
not perfect, they are only going to get better! Moore's Law would suggest that they are going to be twice as powerful in the next two years, sixteen times better in six 
years. 

We are have also seen a change in the drivers of innovation.  Innovation was typically driven my men in suits that have come from commercial and academic institutions 
who come up with brilliant ideas. But the internet, together with the open source movement, has allowed software and hardware to be more accessible and we are now 
seeing a rise in innovation from sources where we don't really care who is coming up with the idea or what their background is or where they come from. Open source is 
growing fast, regardless of whether the said institutions are happy or not.  Technologies such ad 3D printing and services such as Crowdsourcing is also accelerating 
innovation allowing groups of individuals to convert their ideas to reality.

The way in which we are being educated is also changing fast.  It is now common place to get IT related training delivered the internet and less via classroom based 
training. Devices such as tablets are becoming the common place in schools. And we are now seeing the model of higher education change dramatically.  Those who want to 
achieve academic qualifications, but have been unable due to geographical or financial boundaries, are finding that tuition is becoming more and more accessible.  
University of the People (http://uopeople.edu/) is the first *accredited* virtual university to offer high quality tuition at the fraction of the cost.  As the founder 
quoted "A new era is coming, an era that will witness the disruption of the higher education model as we know it today, from being a privilege for the few to becoming a 
basic right, affordable and accessible for all."


##The Future

The computer revolution as described above will have a profound effect on services offered by professional organisations.  Organisations that provide professional 
services must, such as those in the legal sector, must make investments today to protect them for the future.  The rapid change in technology will be force such 
organisations to rethink client engagement and client loyalty strategies. Client demands and expectations which inevitably will be driven by what an organisations 
competitors have to offer to their clients.  

Artificial Intelligence will offer more opportunities to automate mundane tasks conducted by fee earners and support staff, and offer more possibilities in the realm of 
document automation or automate tasks around client due diligence and client engagement. It's inevitable that some chargeable services will become cheaper, 
or dare I say it... free.
 
Using Big Data strategies with historical data will give organisation an insight into how the company has evolved.  Understanding your past may help you better 
understand your future.

##Stop Press!!
Just watched (excuse the pun) the announcement of the Apple Watch and Apple Pay.  Amazing piece of kit and underlines the advancement in wearable tech!


##Final Word
This morning I overheard a conversation where a member of the IT department said "What people don't know about the Apple Watch is that you need an iPhone for it to work 
properly!". It's this attitude that stifles innovative thinking.  Taking it from a positive standpoint, see this first gen device as in insight to what is possible for
 the future.
